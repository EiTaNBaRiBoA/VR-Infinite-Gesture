To do the tutorial, open the "Tutorial" scene, in this folder and hit play.

The first half of the tutorial will help you setup VR. 
You'll need to stop the scene to do certain steps, so watch out for the yellow caution signs.

After you've setup VR (about 8 steps in), 
the tutorial will take you into VR and teach you in VR!

Navigate between steps using the "NEXT" and "BACK" buttons or the arrow keys. 

You can only go between steps while the scene is running!
